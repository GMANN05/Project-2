-Running this code is pretty simple, when you start it up you will get a random number of test scores you have to enter.

Once you enter in all of the scores, it will sort from highest to lowest score, then print out the letter grade next to the percentage, and then it will display the highest score, lowest score, and the average score from all of the inputted test scores.
